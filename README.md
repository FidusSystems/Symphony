# SIMU - Simulation Environment for FPGA
As a design services company, at Fidus we have to be able to quickly simulate our FPGA, independent of the underlying OS or tool or FPGA vendor. 
- short setup time and the learning curve because we don't like wasting time.
- promote all good practices in the field of verification - regression, randomization, scalability, etc.
- flexible scripting structure to switch quickly between different OS, HDL languages and simulation tool vendors. 

# Features
- HDL supported - SystemVerilog, Verilog
- Simulation tools supported - Mentor ModelSim/Questa, Vivado XSim
- TCL based - works inside the tool (Modelsim/Quasta/Vivado) or in OS terminal (Linux/Windows) using the native/installed TCL interpreter 
- A preset template of a test-case, ready to be reused
- Code Coverage statistics reports
- Pass/Fail statistics per test-case and per regression run
- Automated regression executing all test-cases named with a with "tc_" prefix 
- Regression history accumulation
- Multithreaded regression runs for complex simulation environments, executing many test-cases in parallel, requiring one license per thread

# ToDo List
- HDL support for VHDL (almost complete), UVM, HLS
- Simulation tools support - Cadence Incisive, Aldec Riviera, Synopsys VCS
- submit jobs to remote machines
